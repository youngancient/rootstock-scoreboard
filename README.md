# Governance Voting Dashboard

This project is a voting dashboard built using Next.js and integrated with Rootstock Network (EVM compatible smart contracts). It allows users to create teams and vote using governance tokens (ERC20) with advanced role-based administration. The voting process is controlled by the `TeamsManagerCore` smart contract, which manages the creation of teams and tracks the votes.

## Features

### Core Voting Features
- **Create Teams**: Users can create new teams by providing a team name, a meme token address, and a team leader address.
- **Vote for Teams**: Users can vote for their preferred team using governance tokens with configurable limits.
- **Real-time Leaderboard**: Track team scores and user participation with comprehensive vote tracking.
- **Token Balance**: The system tracks the voting token balance of the team leaders.
- **Smart Contracts Integration**: The project uses smart contracts for handling votes, team management, and governance token transactions.
- **ERC20 Support**: The voting process is based on ERC20 tokens, ensuring decentralized governance.
- **Time-bounded Voting**: Configurable voting periods with automatic deadline enforcement.
- **Anti-Gaming Protection**: Prevents team leaders from voting for their own teams.

### Advanced Role-Based Administration

The system implements a sophisticated **5-tier role hierarchy** for secure governance and administration:

#### Admin Role Hierarchy
```
SUPER_ADMIN (4)     → Full system control & oversight
├── RECOVERY_ADMIN (3)  → Emergency functions & crisis management
├── VOTE_ADMIN (2)      → Voting system configuration & management
└── TEAM_MANAGER (1)    → Team creation & team lifecycle management
    └── NONE (0)        → Regular users with no admin privileges
```

#### Role Permissions

**SUPER_ADMIN (Level 4)**
- Complete administrative oversight and system control
- Add, remove, and modify all admin roles
- Resolve emergency mode situations and perform system resets
- Override authority for any system operation

**RECOVERY_ADMIN (Level 3)**
- Trigger system-wide emergency mode during crisis situations
- Emergency token withdrawals and fund recovery operations
- Add emergency admins during critical situations
- Limited to crisis management (cannot modify normal operations)

**VOTE_ADMIN (Level 2)**
- Enable/disable voting periods and configure voting durations
- Set voting parameters including token limits and minimum amounts
- Configure governance tokens and voting mechanics
- Manage voting system configuration

**TEAM_MANAGER (Level 1)**
- Add new teams to the voting system
- Remove or deactivate existing teams
- Update team details and metadata
- Manage team leader assignments

**NONE (Level 0)**
- Cast votes for preferred teams using governance tokens
- View team information and voting status
- No administrative privileges

## Smart Contract: TeamsManagerCore

The core of the project revolves around the `TeamsManagerCore` smart contract (found in Contracts folder), written in Solidity. This contract manages team creation, voting, and tracking the votes with role-based access control. Below is a high-level description of the contract:

### Main Functions

**Voting Functions:**
- `vote(teamName, transferAmount)`: Allows users to vote for a team by transferring governance tokens.
- `setReadyToVote(duration)`: Marks the contract as ready for voting with optional time limit (VOTE_ADMIN+ only).
- `disableVoting()`: Disables voting (VOTE_ADMIN+ only).
- `setVotingLimits(minAmount, maxAmount)`: Configure voting limits (VOTE_ADMIN+ only).

**Team Management Functions:**
- `addTeam(teamName, memeTokenAddress, teamLeaderAddress)`: Allows administrators to add a new team (TEAM_MANAGER+ only).
- `removeTeam(teamName)`: Remove/deactivate a team (TEAM_MANAGER+ only).

**View Functions:**
- `getTeamNames()`: Returns a list of all registered teams.
- `getTeamInfo(teamName)`: Provides detailed information about a team.
- `getScore(teamName)`: Retrieves the current vote score of a team.
- `getUserVoteForTeam(user, teamName)`: Get individual user's votes for specific team.
- `getUserTotalVotes(user)`: Get total votes cast by a user.
- `getVotingStatus()`: Returns current voting state and statistics.

**Admin Functions:**
- `addAdmin(address, role)`: Add new administrator with specific role (SUPER_ADMIN only).
- `removeAdmin(address)`: Remove administrator (SUPER_ADMIN only).
- `changeAdminRole(address, newRole)`: Change admin's role (SUPER_ADMIN only).
- `triggerEmergency()`: Activate emergency mode (RECOVERY_ADMIN only).
- `reset()`: Resets the voting state and team information (SUPER_ADMIN only).
- `emergencyWithdraw(token, to, amount)`: Emergency token withdrawal (RECOVERY_ADMIN+ only).

## Environment Variables

The project requires the following environment variables to function correctly. These should be set in your `.env` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_MANAGER_ADDRESS=<Smart contract address for the TeamsManagerCore>
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=<Ethereum network RPC URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER=<Blockchain explorer URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_URL=<Pinata URL for IPFS data>
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOVERNANCE_TOKEN=<Governance token contract address>
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed.
- **Metamask or Web3 Wallet**: A Web3 wallet is required for signing transactions and interacting with the blockchain.
- **Governance Tokens**: ERC-20 tokens for voting (configurable).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rsksmart/rootstock-scoreboard.git
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file and populate it with the environment variables listed above.**

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open http://localhost:3000 to view the dashboard.**

## Smart Contract Deployment

The `TeamsManagerCore` contract should be deployed to the Rootstock network, and its address should be provided in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_MANAGER_ADDRESS` environment variable. The contract source code can be found in the `contracts` directory.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Compile contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
3. **Deploy & Verify:**
   You can now deploy using the custom `deploy-scoreboard` task. This task handles the deployment of the Mock token (if needed), the Core contract, and triggers automatic verification on the Rootstock Explorer.
   ```bash
   npx hardhat deploy-scoreboard --network rskTestnet
   ```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage with 90+ test cases across all contracts:

```bash
# Run all tests
npx hardhat test

# Test individual contracts
npx hardhat test test/Administrable.test.js      # Basic admin management
npx hardhat test test/TeamsManager.test.js       # Core voting system
npx hardhat test test/AdvancedGovernance.test.js # Complex governance features
```
